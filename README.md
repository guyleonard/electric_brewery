# Electric Brewery
I really like homebrewing and wanted to do more 'brew in a bag' style beers with all grain, rather than relying on DME/LME as the 'base malt'.
I could do it in my previous kettles and the hob but it was a bit of a hassle, so I wanted to get a big 30l pot and brew in that.

##  
I have made a quite a few modifications to the code, but before I commited them to github! Ooops. So I have uploaded the original code from the Instructable and then my code on top, at least that way there is some record of the changes between the original and my updates. For example, I have renamed several of the variables and also have rewritten a couple of functions and added my own to include humidity readings from the DHT11.

## Fritzing
I have included my schematic of the electronic brewery which includes a WEMOS and ARDUINO NANO along with two 4-Character LEDs and an OLED screen for updates.
